## Abstract

There is now a general agreement that the success of CNNs is related to their
insensitivity to translations to detect local patterns. There has been much
work in the past few years to extend this architecture to take advantage of
larger symmetries in the data.

Here the authors focus on spherical signals, where the detection should be
insensitive to 3D rotations. However the plane and the sphere are fundamentally
different (essentially because the group of translations is isomorphic to the
plane, while the group of rotations is not isomorphic to the sphere),
and the result of a spherical convolution is a signal on SO(3), not on the
sphere.

Hence the authors develop the theory of convolution on the sphere and on
the rotation group SO(3) using the generalized Fourier transform. They
finally develop a spherical CNN that is able to perform well on various
spherical signal analysis tasks.

## I - Introduction

* CNNs are able to detect local patterns regardless of their position in the
image, that is **regardless of translations** (by translation equivariance).

* We would like to similarly have a **spherical CNN** that would detect local
patterns **regardless of 3D rotations.**

* However, there is **no good way to use translational convolution
(or cross-correlation) to analyze spherical signals** (spherical rotations
cannot be emulated by translation of the signal's planar projection)

<br>

* Major difference :
  * **The plane acts on itself *via* the isomorphism to translations**, which
  form a subgroup of the symmetry group.
  * The sphere cannot act on itself (it is not a group), hence we must consider
  **the whole of SO(3), which is not isomorphic to the sphere.**

<br>

* Hence the result of a spherical correlation (the output feature map) is to be
considered a **signal on SO(3), not on the sphere $S^2$.** A spherical CNN
would involve **SO(3) group correlation in deeper layers.**

<br>

* In this paper :
  * **Theory of spherical CNNs**, including
  non-commutative harmonic analysis to define $S^2$ and SO(3) correlations
  (first use of cross-correlations on a continuous group inside a deep neural
  network)
  * **Efficient implementation using generalized Fast Fourier Transform**
  * Empirical support for the utility of spherical CNNs for rotation-invariant
  learning problems.

## II - Related work

* The power of CNNs stems in large part from their ability to exploit
translational symmetries (using weight sharing, translational equivariance).

* Natural **generalization to larger groups of symmetries.**

* Previous work :
  * Discrete groups (except SO(2)-steerable networks)
  * Analysis of spherical images, but architecture not equivariant

<br>

* In comparison, this work achieves equivariance to a continuous,
non-commutative group (SO(3)), and uses generalized Fourier transform for
fast group correlation.

## III - Correlation on the sphere and rotation group

* **Planar correlation** - The value of the output feature map at translation
$x \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ is computed as an inner product between the input feature
map and a filter, shifted by $x$.

* **Spherical correlation** - The value of the output feature map evaluated at
rotation $R \in$ SO(3) is computed as an inner product between the input feature
map and a filter, rotated by $R$.

* Noting, for $R \in$ SO(3), $L_R$ the rotation operator such that
$[L_R f](x) = f(R^{-1}x)$, we define the spherical correlation for spherical
signals $f$ and $\psi$ (over K channels) as :

<strong>

\[  
  [\psi * f] = \left< L_R \psi, f \right>
    = \int_{S^2} \sum_{i=1}^K \psi_k (R^{-1}x) f_k(x) dx
\]

</strong>

<br>

* **Rotation group correlation** - Similarly, naturally extending the rotation
operator to signals on SO(3), we define the rotation group correlation for
signals $f$ and $\psi$ on SO(3) as :

<strong>

\[  
  [\psi * f] = \left< L_R \psi, f \right>
    = \int_{\text{SO(3)}} \sum_{i=1}^K \psi_k (R^{-1}Q) f_k(Q) dQ
\]

</strong>

<br>

* **Equivariance** - A layer $\Phi$ is equivariant if
$\Phi \circ L_R = T_R \circ \Phi$ for some operator $T_R$. We show that
planar, spherical and rotation group correlations are equivariant.

## IV - Fast spherical correlation with G-FFT

* Correlations and convolutions can be computed efficiently using the
**Fast Fourier Transform** in $O(n \log n)$, faster than the naive $O(n^2)$
implementation.

* For functions on the sphere and rotation group, there is an analogous
transform, the **generalized Fourier Transform**, and a corresponding fast
algorithm **G-FFT**.

<br>

* Conceptually, the **GFT is a linear projection of a function onto a set
of orthogonal basis functions** called *matrix elements of irreducible unitary
representations*.

* Denoting the manifold by $X$ and the corresponding basis functions by $U^l$,
we can write the GFT of a function $f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as

<strong>

\[
  \hat{f}^l = \int_X f(x) \bar{U^l(x)} dx
\]

</strong>

<br>

* The inverse SO(3) Fourier transform is defined (with the Wigner D-functions)
as :

\[
  f(R) = \sum_{l=0}^b (2l+1) \sum_{m=-l}^l \sum_{n=-l}^l \hat{f}^l_{mn}
  D^l_{mn}(R)
\]

<br>

* The maximum frequency $b$ is known as the **bandwidth**, and is related to the
resolution of the spatial grid.

## V - Experiments

### V.1 - Equivariance error

* Check if the equivariance empirically still holds for the discretized versions
fo the continuous functions used (the theory only holds for continuous functions
on the sphere or rotation group).

* Although the approximation error grows with the resolution and the number
of layers, it stays manageable in practice.


<br>

<br>

* Additional experiments show that spherical CNN work reasonably well on various
tasks involving spherical signals, although not specifically designed to solve
those.
